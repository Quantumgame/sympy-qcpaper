\begin{abstract}

The simulation of quantum computers and quantum information systems on classical computers
is an important part of quantum information science.  With such simulations, algorithms can be developed and tested, experiments can be validated and insight can be gained about the foundations of quantum information.  We have developed an open source software package for simulating quantum computers symbolically using a computer algebra system, SymPy.  The symbolic manipulation of gates and circuits has many advantages over the traditional numerical approach where gates and qubits are represented as large matrices and vectors.  In this work, we introduce the software, describe its features through examples and outline the advantages of this approach.

\section{SymPy}

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a
full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as
possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written
entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.

SymPy was started in 2005 by Ondřej Čertík and it now has an active community
of over 100 developers contributing to it. SymPy is BSD licensed and anyone can
easily contribute new features and algorithms by submitting a GitHub pull
request. SymPy has been periodically participating in the Google Summer of Code
(25 students in 5 years) and the quantum computing module has started as one
such project as well.

\begin{verbatim}
from __future__ import division
from sympy import *
x, y, z, t = symbols('x y z t')
k, m, n = symbols('k m n', integer=True)
f, g, h = symbols('f g h', cls=Function)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
((x+y)**2 * (x+1)).expand()
\end{verbatim}

$ x^{3} + 2 x^{2} y + x^{2} + x y^{2} + 2 x y + y^{2} $

\begin{verbatim}
solve(Eq(x**3 + 2*x**2 + 4*x + 8, 0), x)
[-2*I, 2*I, -2]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
limit((sin(x)-x)/x**3, x, 0)
\end{verbatim}

$ - \frac{1}{6} $

\begin{verbatim}
(1/cos(x)).series(x, 0, 6)
\end{verbatim}

$ 1 + \frac{1}{2} x^{2} + \frac{5}{24} x^{4} + \mathcal{O}\left(x^{6}\right) $

% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column
% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use
% sparingly.
%\begin{widetext}

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}

% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape
% figure
% \begin{turnpage}
% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}

% \end{turnpage}

% tables should appear as floats within the text
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
% reasonable default table settings.
% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
% in longtable).
% \begin{table}%[H] add [H] placement to break table across pages
% \caption{\label{}}
% \begin{ruledtabular}
% \begin{tabular}{}
% Lines of table here ending with \\
